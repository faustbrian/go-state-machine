# Contributing

## Before Editing

1. Read the README, [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the affected API contract.
2. Start with `go test ./...` or a focused package/test selector.
3. Inspect direct consumers when changing a public or composition contract.
4. Preserve unrelated work and generated/corpus provenance.

An ordinary fix stays in this repository. It does not require sibling checkouts,
Tools edits, ecosystem catalog updates or agent-goal ledgers. Change manifests
only when their owned facts change, not merely because source changed.

## Changes

Keep commits focused and conventional. Update changelogs for material public
behavior, compatibility or adoption changes, not CI-only administration.
Public API changes require compatibility
evidence and documentation. Specification behavior requires a decision record,
fixture coverage, and interoperability evidence.

New direct dependencies and dependency updates must follow the
[dependency governance policy](AGENTS.md#dependencies-and-supply-chain). Package-local
update bots are forbidden; the root policy owns every module and action update.

Specification-backed changes must follow the
[specification governance contract](AGENTS.md#design), update
the affected stable decision entries, and complete the Specification Decisions
section of the pull request template. An unresolved interpretation or stale
source pin is release-blocking; peer behavior cannot silently select policy.

Mutation is optional developer-local or selected scheduled assurance, not a PR
prerequisite. Investigate viable survivors and add focused regressions for real
defects; moving a campaign off PRs does not waive a confirmed correctness or
security defect. Equivalent/invalid mutants retain reviewed narrow dispositions.

Do not add package-local workflows, permanent replacements, machine-specific
paths, bypass flags, broad mutation exclusions, or aggregate quality metrics
that hide a failing package.

## Verification

Classify changes under [proportional assurance](AGENTS.md#proportional-assurance).
The root module collects complete native coverage in explicit evidence mode.
Failed tests, missing packages and invalid or absent profiles remain errors;
behavioral risk review replaces universal exact-percentage acceptance.
Cancellation and immutable-preflight guards, security checks and fail-closed
required results remain intact.

For ordinary source work, `go test ./...` runs deterministic tests, fuzz seeds
and saved corpus regressions without PostgreSQL or Docker. Use the qualified
public Golib v2.1.1 verifier declared in `.golib.yaml` for repository checks:

```bash
make inventory
make check
make ci
```

`check` and `ci` use bounded local checks, including the named compiled-machine,
memory-store and runner race regressions in `.golib.yaml`; they do not run full
mutation or fuzz campaigns. Documentation changes need relevant structure, links
and examples, not unrelated runtime work. Public API, concurrency and persistence
changes retain their affected compatibility, race or integration checks.

The manifest-driven Make checks also provision PostgreSQL and run tagged
integration tests, requiring Docker. The default Go command above and focused
standalone race selections do not provision services. For a narrow change,
select its relevant package tests rather than the complete manifest route.

For active exploration, select one fuzz target and a small budget; long campaigns
belong in scheduled assurance. Optional local mutation selects one package with
the qualified verifier. These examples are not all-change requirements:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzSerializedHistory$' -fuzztime=2s -parallel=1 -timeout=2m .
golib mutation --module . --package .
```

For changes to the PostgreSQL persistence or lease contract, run the affected
integration tests with a working Docker daemon or a disposable database selected
through `POSTGRES_URL`:

```bash
go test -tags=integration ./postgres
```

`make check-full` retains online specification validation and explicit full
assurance with the original fuzz budgets. Relevant release qualification uses
`golib release dry-run --module .`. Select these for their material risk or
release boundary, not every commit. Report unavailable or failed checks honestly;
a fast local pass is not public-release or hosted-CI qualification.
CI/configuration-only changes do not require a module release.

## Adding A Module

Follow [repository structure policy](AGENTS.md#repository-structure). New modules
require an explicit purpose, ownership boundary, dependency review, package
catalog entry, full quality gates, documentation, changelog, license, security
policy, compatibility plan, and release dry-run.
